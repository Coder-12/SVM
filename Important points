Dear Students,

According to the slide from the first week of classes, the project report is due on November 24th. However considering that many of you are lagging behind in the work, I am extending the deadline to November 27th 11.55pm. 

The project report must be formatted according to the AAAI style The page limit on the project report is 5 pages (including references). The report should describe the following

- abstract - overall idea of the project, what is proposed and what is the outcome (in around 100 words)
- introduction - what is the problem? why is the problem important? what important ideas did you explore?
- related work - what are some of the related literature on the problem (and the solution)?
- methodology - how did you solve the problem?
- results and discussion - what were your experiments? what are the results? what are your observations? (use plots and tables to document the results)
- summary - what was the overall outcome of the project?
- future work - if you had more time, how would you continue the project?

Evaluation of the project will include (not limited to) the following points
- is the methodology technically sound? 10-15%
- quality of the experimental design - 10-15%
- discussion of the results - 10-15%
- novelty - 5%
- readability of the report (are the ideas well presented? are there any grammatical errors/typos?) 5%



    It is expected that you will implement SVM from scratch. You also have to implement the optimizer for solving the quadratic optimization. 
    Discuss the challenges while implementing the optimizer. Add them to your preliminary draft.
    Use standard benchmark datasets to compare your implementation against available toolkit solvers.



Data - Artificial Data.
Data - Higgs Boson.
